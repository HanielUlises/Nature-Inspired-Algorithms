# Nature-Inspired Algorithms Repository

This repository contains implementations of various nature-inspired algorithms, organized by technique. These algorithms are inspired by natural processes, such as evolution, swarming, and adaptive behaviors, and are widely used for approaching a solution to complex optimization and search problems.

## Techniques (so far)

### Evolutionary Algorithms
The **Evolutionary Algorithms** folder contains algorithms inspired by the principles of evolution, where a population of candidate solutions undergoes selection, mutation, and recombination. This category includes:
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Mimic natural selection by evolving populations of solutions through selection, crossover, and mutation.

### Genetic Algorithms
The **Genetic Algorithms** folder focuses on implementations of genetic algorithms (GAs). These algorithms are well-suited for optimization problems and use processes like selection, crossover, and mutation to "evolve" better solutions over generations.

### Optimization
The **Optimization** folder contains algorithms designed for efficiently finding optimal solutions to complex problems
- **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)**: Inspired by the foraging behavior of ants, ACO algorithms use a system of "pheromone" trails to guide the search for optimal paths or solutions.
- **Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO)**: Based on the social behavior of birds and fish, PSO optimizes by having particles "swarm" toward optimal solutions based on personal and group knowledge.

### Tabu Search
An iterative local search algorithm that avoids cycling back to previously visited solutions by maintaining a "tabu list" of recent solutions, it efficiently explores the solution space to find optimal or near-optimal results. The approach here was a packing problem NP-Hard, trying to optimize the search for an optimal solution 

### Utils
Here are utility functions, helper scripts, and shared code used across multiple algorithm implementations.
